BlockTracker
============

Wrapper over [scanmem](https://github.com/coolwanglu/scanmem) to provide simple visuals for the [Tetris: The Grandmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris:_The_Grand_Master) series. 

Usage:

    blocktracker <pid> <level_address>

It's very rough around the edges so far. Keeps track of buttons pressed per level, a level graph (per section of 100 levels), and a simple button display.
